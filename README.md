# -Image-Clustering-Final-Project-Fall-2024
Subject: COMP-605-T05 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

## Project Overview
This project is divided into two parts:

1. **Final Project: Image Clusters  for Dog and Cat Classification**
   - Focuses on building a machine learning model to classify images of dogs and cats.
   - Includes data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and visualization of results.

2. **Final Project: Image Clusters  for Flowers Classification**
   - Explores a different AI/ML model workflow.
   - Contains steps like data cleaning, feature engineering, training, and testing the model.

## Team Contributions

The project has been divided among four contributors for clarity and focused work. The tasks are distributed as follows:

### File 1: Contributions by Priyankkumar and Neel
- Handled the first project focusing on image clustering for dogs and cats.
- Contributions include:
  - Initial data exploration and preprocessing.
  - Setting up the model architecture.
  - Writing code for initial training iterations.

### File 2: Contributions by Tirth and Nachiketbhai
- Managed the second project focusing on image clustering for flowers.
- Contributions include:
  - Fine-tuning the model and optimizing hyperparameters.
  - Final evaluation and generation of performance metrics.
  - Visualizing results and conclusions.

## File Structure

The project files are structured as follows:

### Final Project: Image Clusters  for Dog and Cat Classification
- `Final_Project_Image_Cluster_Dog&Cat.ipynb`: Contributions by Priyankkumar and Neel.

### Final Project: Image Clusters for Flowers Classification
- `Final_Project_Image_Cluster_Flowers.ipynb`: Contributions by Tirth and Nachiketbhai.

## How to Run the Project

1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:
   - Python (version 3.8 or later)
   - Required libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `tensorflow`/`keras`, etc.
   - Use the `requirements.txt` file to install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. Open the Jupyter notebooks in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Lab, VS Code, or Google Colab).

3. Execute the cells sequentially:
   - For **Dog and Cat Classification**, use `Final_Project_Image_Cluster_Dog&Cat.ipynb`.
   - For **Flower Classification**, use `Final_Project_Image_Cluster_Flowers.ipynb`.

4. Review the outputs and visualizations for insights.

## Dependencies

Use the following `requirements.txt` file to install the necessary libraries:

```txt
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
tensorflow
keras
```
